## About The Project

![Image of application](/public/etch-a-sketch-screenshot.JPG)

#### Etch A Sketch Application

This project is an Etch A Sketch application built using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. I started this personal project to enhance my skills in front-end development and to learn more about these technologies.

#### Features

- Drawing: Users can draw on the canvas by holding down their mouse button and moving their cursor around the screen.

- Resizing: The canvas can be resized by adjusting the Grid Size slider. When the slider value changes, the grid is cleared and a new grid size with the new value is generated.

- Customization: Users can choose from 3 different coloring modes. Color Mode, Rainbow Mode and Eraser Mode.

- Responsive Design: The application is designed to work on various screen sizes, making it accessible across different devices.

#### What I Learned

- Event Handling in React: Became proficient in handling user events such as mouse movements and clicks in React.

- CSS Styling with Tailwind: Explored the capabilities of Tailwind CSS for styling components and customizing the application's appearance without writing custom CSS.

- React Component Lifecycle: I gained a deeper understanding of React's component lifecycle and how to manage state and props effectively.

- Exposure to React Hooks. Through practical application, I learned to manage state, interact with DOM elements, and handle side effects in functional components.
